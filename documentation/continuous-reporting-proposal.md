# Proposal for Continuous KSI Validation Reporting

## Executive Summary

Knox AI enables true continuous compliance monitoring for FedRAMP Key Security Indicators (KSIs) through automated, AI-driven validation that runs every 6 hours. This proposal outlines our comprehensive approach to continuously reporting on 100% of KSI validations, providing federal agencies with real-time visibility into security posture and enabling proactive risk management.

## Current State vs. Future State

### Traditional Reporting (Current State)
- **Frequency**: Quarterly or annual assessments
- **Coverage**: 10-20% sampling of resources
- **Delivery**: Static PDF reports
- **Lag Time**: 30-90 days from assessment to report
- **Actionability**: Limited, often outdated by delivery

### Knox AI Continuous Reporting (Future State)
- **Frequency**: Every 6 hours (configurable)
- **Coverage**: 100% of resources, all KSIs
- **Delivery**: Real-time dashboards, APIs, and alerts
- **Lag Time**: <5 minutes from scan to availability
- **Actionability**: Immediate with remediation guidance
